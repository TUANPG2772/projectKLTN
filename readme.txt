Li-Fi Project Guide
Introduction
This project leverages Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) technology to transmit and process data via light. The system consists of two main parts: a Li-Fi transmitter and a Li-Fi receiver. The received data is displayed on a 4DCAPE-70T screen and can also be remotely controlled via SSH.

Hardware
Hardware Requirements:
BeagleBone Black.
4DCAPE-70T touchscreen display.
A camera for receiving light signals.
Li-Fi transmitter (LED) and receiver (LDR or light sensor).
Power supply for all devices.
Setup Instructions:
Power On: Ensure all devices are powered on before starting the system.
Li-Fi Signal Transmission:
Connect the Li-Fi transmitter to the system.
Ensure the camera is positioned to correctly receive signals from the transmitter.
Display and Control:
All system statuses and received Li-Fi signals are displayed on the 4DCAPE-70T screen.
Alternatively, you can use SSH to access and control the application on the BeagleBone Black without using the 4DCAPE-70T display.
Software
Primary Functions:
Communicate and process signals from the Li-Fi transmitter and receiver.
Decode the received data into meaningful information.
Support communication via socket and UART.
Software Structure:
Decode Li-Fi from Flash:

Continuously read data using the camera.
Apply a binary tree algorithm to decode Morse signals.
Use IIR filtering to process input signals.
Transmit Li-Fi via Light Source:

Demonstrate by using a smartphone to send text or QR code data through Li-Fi.
Data Display:

The 4DCAPE-70T screen displays system status and received data.
Remote configuration and control via SSH are also supported.
Running the Project
1. Prepare the System:
Connect the hardware according to the setup instructions.
Power on all devices.
2. Boot the BeagleBone:
Start the system and execute the main application from the terminal.
3. Transmit Li-Fi Signals:
Use the Li-Fi transmitter to send signals.
The camera captures the signals and sends them to the BeagleBone for decoding.
4. Display and Control:
Data and system statuses are shown on the 4DCAPE-70T screen.
Use SSH to remotely control or configure the system if needed.
Project Expansion
Natural Light as a Li-Fi Source:

Utilize sunlight as the light source for transmitting Li-Fi signals.
Integrate AI to recognize and process signals from multiple Li-Fi sources.
Energy Efficiency:

Use natural light during the day.
At night, use solar energy stored during the day to power the Li-Fi transmitter.
